# Old Car Price Prediction

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as year, model, mileage, etc. Machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been utilized to build a predictive model. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from Kaggle. It includes several features that are commonly used to determine the price of a car.
